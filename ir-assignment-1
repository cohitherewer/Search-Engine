Query Path:

1. Write a program to index the FIRE english document collection using StandardAnalyzer. 

2. Write a program that takes a FIRE query file as input and creates a ranked list of 1000 documents for each query. Additionally, use the description of the query along with the query terms to search over the collection. Your program should take a string (either "onlyquery" or "querywithdesc") to expand the queries and search over the collection.

The results need to be printed in TREC format (<query number> Q0 <document id> <rank> <similarity score> <rollno>). Use Lucene's default scorer to rank the documents. 


INSTRUCTIONS: 

1. Submit two python programs

Naming convention: mtcXXXX-indexer.py and
   mtc18XX-searcher.java

Make sure your programs can be compiled something like: 

python3 mtcXXXX-indexer.py /path/to/adhoc.fire.en/en.docs.2011
   /path/to/directory/where/index/should/be/stored

python3 mtc18XX-searcher.py /index/path /path/to/adhoc.fire.en/en.topics.126-175.2011.txt /path/to/search/results/file


3. You should also save the output of the following command,

trec_eval -q /path/to/en.qrels.126-175.2011.txt /path/to/search/results/file

in a file, and submit these files as well. 

Naming convention:

mtcXXXX-default.txt
mtcXXXX-query-description.txt


4. You are permitted to discuss the problem with classmates and to consult
   Internet sources, but the actual programs have to be written by you
   alone without copy-pasting / looking at anyone else's code. We will run
   moss to check for copying.

Please let us know if you have any questions/doubts.
